# Creative Destruction

## Notes

Creative destruction is the idea that progress is not a smooth linear line and small increments, but rather a cycle of destruction and reconstruction with large increments of improvements.
This term is originated from economics but is also relevant for other fields.

For example, cameras used film as its source of photography for many years, and this was the truth across the industry. The rise of the digital camera was not a small gradual change but rather a "violent" destruction of the industry that has changed it from side to side.

Many economists believe that true progress requires destruction so that we should allow the economy to run its course and not intervene in it.
If our economy is structured in a way that competitors that should bring forth the creative destruction can't rise, then progress is denied. This can happen either when:
1. A natural monopoly rises and has the power to prevent competitors from rising
2. A government led protection keeps companies alive, thus preventing the threat from forcing the industry to change.

Creative destruction is also a synonym for natural selection, the idea that the old has to be destroyed, and is naturally destroyed, in the process of something new, better, stronger.

At the individual level, we can see such cases when a person wants or forced to change. Traumas or (Related:: [[Content/Notes/Struggle\|Challenge]]) are moments where we feel like "do or die", either having important realizations and make ourselves (Related:: [[Content/Notes/Adaptability\|adaptable]]) to the situation, or we wither and fall into (Jump:: [[depression\|depression]]). Unfortunately, as with other cases of creative destruction, this meaningful change can't come without paying the price of the destruction of the old, that's why many people have epiphanies after near death situations, although the event itself didn't provide any new information, it just cleared the ground for something new to rise.

This means that it is up to us how to (Related:: [[Content/Notes/Freedom of response\|react]]) to a crisis, and that even painful events can lead to positive things (Related:: [[Content/Notes/Happiness is an internal state\|Happiness is an internal state]])
