# Philosophers Code

Welcome!

So happy you are here. You might ask where "here" is. The most honest answer would be - welcome to my brain. Weird, right? Let me explain. This is my "knowledge vault", every book I've read, every concept I thought about, every idea I wanted to share with the world, it's all in here for you to enjoy (or not, that's up to you).

Feel free to roam around, but if you are looking for some suggestions, see the following sections:
